# Breast-Cancer-Predictor

We created a random forest model to predict whether someone would have a recurrence of breast cancer based on parameters including age, node count, and irritability. To optimize the class of the model and the model itself, we varied the n-estimators, tree depth, maximum features, random state, and model type. After 100 trials with each model, the following accuracy values were discovered:

  LinearSVC : 80.95% "\n"
  DecisionTreeClassifier: 76.88%
  LogisticRegression: 83.33%
  KNeighborsClassifier: 76.19%
  GaussianNB: 76.19%
  RandomForestClassifier: 86.49%

We ultimately settled on a RandomForestClassifier model with a 67% True Positive Rate and a 94% True Negative Rate.
